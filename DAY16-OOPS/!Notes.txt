1.A constructor is a unique method used to initialize an object of the class.

2.Python will provide a default constructor if no constructor is defined.

3.Constructor is not a method and doesn’t return anything. it returns None

4.In Python, we have three types of constructor default, Non-parametrized, and parameterized constructor.

5.Using self, we can access the instance variable and instance method of the object.

6.The first argument self refers to the current object.

7.Constructor overloading is not possible in Python.

8.If the parent class doesn’t have a default constructor, then the compiler would not insert a 
default constructor in the child class.

9.A child class constructor can also invoke the parent class constructor using the super() method.

---------------------------DESTRUCTOR-------------------------

1.In object-oriented programming, A destructor is called when an object is deleted or destroyed.

2.Destructor is used to perform the clean-up activity before destroying the object,
such as closing database connections or filehandle.

3.In Python we use __del__() method to perform clean-up task before deleting the object.

4.The destructor will not invoke when we delete object reference. It will only 
invoke when all references to the objects get deleted.
